# Deep-Learning-for-Physical-Systems
Deep Learning for Prediction &amp; Analysis of Thermal Errors for Efficient CNC Machining

This project was a part of our Deep Learning course at IIT Ropar. We predicted and analysed the thermal errors to make CNC machining more efficient. 
Libraries used: scipy, sklearn, seaborn, keras; 
Techniques applied: PCA, KMeans, Neural Networks, Regression- Linear and Polynomial, Correlation clustering;
Additional Research: Research papers, Mechanical Engineering course books

The Project Presentation and Python code has been added as a file in this repository.
